description: Update the main README.md with the latest docs.
---

Your task is to update the README.md file so it closely matches the current library implementation.

Do so following this general structure:

- Installation
- Basic Usage
- Available Providers
- Advanced Usage
- Contributing

Normally, you will have to update the "Basic Usage", "Available Providers" and "Advanced Usage" sections, but also ensure the Installation and Contributing sections are updated, the latter encouraging potential contributors to help in the development.
